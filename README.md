## 30/1/2022 Ledger Live 2.37.2


Hi, if anyone here use Algorand with ledger live like I do.
There is one bug, after you use Yieldly or Algofi,
your Ledger live won't work as expected anymore.
I had existing Algorand for Yieldly but I can't add new Algorand account for upcoming Governance.

This is hotfix only, and hope ledger fix this shitty bug soon, I'm tired of contact ledger support.
This year I contact support for many simple bugs, no more bug report in 2021.
1. go to C:\Program Files\Ledger Live\resources\app.asar.unpacked\node_modules\@ledgerhq\ledger-core\build\Release
2. rename ledger-core.dll to ledger-core_ori.dll
3. download ledger-core.dll from my github
